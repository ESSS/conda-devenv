Stable release
--------------

To install conda-devenv, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install conda-devenv -c conda-forge


Or if you prefer PIP:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install conda-devenv


Both methods are fine, as they will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
